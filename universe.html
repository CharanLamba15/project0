        <p class="lead">The quote above shows that Stephen Hawking is 
          curious about why does the universe exist. But I am very curious
          about why us humans exist. Because we are the only life form on
          this planet that builds structures 1000 times taller than us. We 
          also build spaceships to go moon and soon other planets. But why
          are the only species in the universe who can do things like this.
          That's why we must learn what else is out there in the universe.
